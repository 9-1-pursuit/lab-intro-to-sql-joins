# SQL Joins

I chose to do the activity for #4 using the bonus challenges in the lesson notes.  I got more familiar with the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN.  I also learned how JOIN uses primary and foreign keys to create tables.  Another thing I learned was how to find the row ID of a table item given another column value.
