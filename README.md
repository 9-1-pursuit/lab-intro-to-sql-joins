### In Canvas, answer the following questions:

- Which resource did you choose to use?
<br>
I chose to do the SQL BOT AND part of the SQL ZOO to reinforce the new queries and syntax we learned about in SQL so far

- What are three things you learned during this lab?<br>
I learned the correct order of execution of a query<br>
I learned how to use the DISTINCT keyword to remove duplicate results in a query<br>
I learned how to use the AS keyword with expressions to give the resulting expression an alias column name<br>
I learned how to combine the GROUPED BY key with aggregate functions to group rows that have the same value in the column specified<br>
I learned when CREATE TABLE, you can add the default values and contraints to a column in the same command
