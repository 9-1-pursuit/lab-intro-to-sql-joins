### In Canvas, answer the following questions:

- Which resource did you choose to use?

The resource I chose was SQL Zoo.

- What are three things you learned during this lab?

I learned there are functions that we can use when making a selection such as ROUND(f,p).
i learned that using '<>' will exclude that value from the selection.
I learned that using the keyword IN allows us to check if an item is in a list.
